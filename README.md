# Immune-Response-to-Tumor-Growth
Lund University - Physiological Models and Computations (FRTF01) final project

MainScript: run one model variation for entire time

ExperimentalScript: run 2 model variations at different times

getParameters: select variation's parameters from table

population_plot: plotting function to plot populations separately or together

BasicModel_xx: current plots for the 4 variations (only nn looks correct. nl, ln, ll have oscillations in tumor population and MATLAB says it is excluding negative or imaginary values)
